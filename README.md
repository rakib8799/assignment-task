# Assignment Task

It is an assignment task-based small website project using ReactJS, and Bootstrap.

The task is to use the [Dummy JSON's Users API](https://dummyjson.com/users) endpoint and make a user list application using ReactJS.

## Functional requirements:

1. Make a user list page where I want to see all the “Users” in a card view.

2. As a user, If I click on a user’s name, it will open a separate page and will show user details.

3. Add a search input field to the top of the list. If I type here, it will search based on the user's name.

4. Add a select input field to the top of the list to sort the users with the following options:
   a. Sort by name
   b. Sort by email
   c. Sort by Company name

5. Add a form in the user list page where I can add users with all the information mentioned above.
